          <h2>My Career</h2>
          <p>As a kid I played as many sports as I could. I absolutely loved it. I went from playing soccer to tennis to football to basketball, and so much more. However, I soon
              became busy with school and had to choose what I loved most. Thus, I stuck with soccer and ended up playing my entire life,
              from when I was four until I left for college.

            <h2>Favorite Teams</h2>
            <p>Of course, with growing up playing sports, came watching as much as I could, and being from Los Angeles, I have plenty of teams to 
                root for. The Dodgers, Lakers, and Kings have all had my support for as long as I can remember, and with the Kings winning the Stanley Cup in 2014, and the Lakers and Dodgers winning their respective
                championships in 2020, it has been good being a Los Angeles sports fan. However, wuth soccer being my favoirte sport, and no real
                compettion in the US, I turned to Europe where I support Barcelona in Spain.

            <h2>Favorite Athletes</h2>
            <p>Now to the players. Those I Idolized growing up. To start, Lionel Messi, the greatest soccer player to ever live. He was my soccer idol and 
                I wanted to be just like him, quick with the ball, a left foot like no other, and the ability to take free kicks like it was a penalty shot. Next, obvisouly being from LA,
                Kobe Bryant. I grew up watching the Lakers and with that came watching Kobe dominate on the court. Finally, when I was little, I always wanted to be the fastest,
                and thus, only one man is there to watch, Usian Bolt. No doubt about ti the fastest man to ever live. Watching him in the Olympics every four years was a highlight, and no matter what,
                he would smoke the compettion.
