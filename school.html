          <h2>Lower and Middle School</h2>
          <p>My parents made the decision to move to Westlake Village as it had a great public school system. 
              Thus, I started my schooling journey at Westlake Hills Elementary School. Here I learned the basics setting me up 
              for future success. After graduating elementary school, I moved onto Colina Middle School where I stayed for the next three years.</p>

          <h2>High School</h2>
          <p>After my early years, I arrived at Westlake High School. This is where school became real as my grades 
              and extracirriculars started to matter for college. I worked hard in high school, taking honors and AP classes as well as being involved
              in sports, school clubs, and outside volunteering. It was a great four years, and although it was a lot of work, it was worth it and the friends I made there will definitely 
              last a lifetime.</p>

            <h2>College</h2>
            <p>Now to college. The University of Michigan, the greatest school on the planet. I was scared at first to come here as 
                I knew no one, it was very far from home, and I had to experience an actual winter. However, I could not be happier. I am involved 
                in a social fraternity as well as a technology consulting group called Reach. It has been an extremely fast two years, and I cannot wait to see  
                what the next two have to offer.
