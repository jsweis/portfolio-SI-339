              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>I was born on October 10, 2000 in Los Angeles, California, and lived in Venice, CA until I was three years old. After that short time living on the Venice Canals, my family moved to the suburbs of Los Angeles. 
                  We moved to a suburb called Westlake Village where I have lived ever since until recently moving to Ann Arbor, Michigan for college.</p>

              <h2>Growing Up</h2>
              <p>I do not remember much of my life in Venice as I moved when I was three, but growing up in Westlake Village, CA was great.
                  We were away from the busy city life and had more time to relax and spend time as a family. Growing up, I lived a fairly normal life;
                  going to school, playing sports, and doing whatever else on the side. Although I get homesick at times, moving and going to school in Ann Arbor
                  has been the time of my life.

                <h2>Family</h2>
                <p>My family is one of the most important parts of my life. It includes my dad, Howard, my mom, Melanie, and my sister, Allison. 
                    My sister and I are only seventeen months apart so we have grown really close as we have grown up togther. Also she goes to the University of Michigan as well.
                    Now my family has gone from supporting Texas and UCLA to strictly Michigan (Go Blue!). There is also a part of my family I have not mentioned. 
                    My dogs Mocha and Penny who are now 13 and 11 and have been in my life as long as I can remember.</p>
