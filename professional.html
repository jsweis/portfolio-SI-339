          <h2>Teacher's Assistant</h2>
          <p>My first job I ever had was working as a teacher's assitant at my temple. For work, I helped prepare students
              for their bar or bat mitzvahs. I helped them learn to read Hebrew and chant prayers. I started working their my freshman year of high school 
              and worked through my senior year.

          <h2>Mathnasium</h2>
          <p>My next job was at a math learning center called Mathnasium. I worked here starting my junior year and worked until I left for college.
              I started as an instructor where I taught elementary through high school math, but was then promoted to a lead instructor 
              where I trained new employees and spoke with parents about the program.

            <h2>Homrun Group</h2>

                helps Israeli start ups get their foot into the North American Market. This summer I will be working as an analyst helping
